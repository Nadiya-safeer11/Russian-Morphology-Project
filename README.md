# Russian Morphology Project

This repository contains Python code for applying Russian case transformations. The script applies six grammatical cases (nominative, genitive, dative, accusative, instrumental, and prepositional) to Russian nouns. The code covers different noun types, including masculine, feminine, neuter, and irregular nouns.

## Features:
- Russian case system implementation for singular and plural forms.
- Handles regular and irregular nouns.
- Easy to use and extend with more noun examples.

## How to Run:
1. Clone this repository.
2. Run the Python script `Russian.ipynb` using Jupyter Notebook or any Python IDE.
3. Modify the `noun` variable in the script to test different Russian nouns.
